        My story begins with my son, Z.
      </p>

      <p>
        From day one, my son had feeding problems. In the hospital, my wife tried to breastfeed, but he
        wouldn’t latch and my wife’s milk supply had not come in. The lactation specialist in the hospital
        had the attitude of “just keep going until it works”, and it never got there while we were in the
        hospital.
      </p>

      <p>
        At home, the struggles continued as we attempted to bottle feed our son. Try as we might, he seemed
        more interested in sleeping than in eating, and eating was no pleasure for any of us involved. The
        rule when a baby comes home is that they should be fed every two hours, from start of feed to the
        start of the next one. Well, when we’d feed him, it would take a whole hour for him to simply get an
        ounce down, and he’d be so tired he’d just conk out at the end. That would give us time to put him
        down, clean the bottle, breathe for a bit, and… you guessed it, it was time to start the
        preparations for the next bottle.
      </p>

      <p>
        This vicious cycle continued until we went for our first appointment with the pediatrician. We went
        in and got him weighed. He had already lost 10 oz since his birth. The nurse raked my wife over the
        coals for not feeding him enough. We explained our struggle and the response we received was “Well,
        do whatever it takes to make sure he doesn’t sleep and finishes eating. Undress him, wipe him with
        cool water, etc.”
      </p>

      <p>
        We were feeling disheartened, like we had failed our son, and were being told that it was not our
        ignorance, but our empathy that was harming him. My wife broke down into tears just thinking about
        things. I, finding professional advice lacking, decided to look into everything around the feeding
        process that could be impacting things.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned that the major thing impacting my son’s feeding at the time had to do with the flow rate on
        his bottles’ nipples. We didn’t realize that was even a thing. We had been trying to feed him using a
        nipple designed for older infants, and required a higher sucking strength to get any milk at all.
        Once we changed bottles/nipples, his feeding made a major leap forward, still taking an hour, but getting
        double or more the formula he had been getting previously. And we breathed a sigh of relief as we
        saw so many improvements from that in weight gain, energy levels, and getting some of our time back.
        We asked ourselves, why had the pediatrician not asked us any questions around this?
      </p>

      <p>
        Now while things had improved significantly, we had now become hyper-aware of my son’s feeding
        behaviors, and something was still off. While his feeding times had improved, they still weren’t
        within the timeframes people said they should be, and he seemed to struggle a bit. My wife’s friend
        recommended we have our pediatrician look to see if there was a tongue or lip tie that could be
        impacting things. We called and the pediatrician had us come in saying he would look at how feeding
        our son typically went, so bring him hungry. He came into the appointment, and rather than watching
        us feed our son, he flipped up my son’s lip and went, “Yup, he has a lip tie. You’ll need to set an
        appointment with a pediatric dentist to take care of that.” We set up the surgery, and when the
        dentist went in he said, “I’m not worried about the lip tie, that looks normal. I’m worried about the
        posterior tongue tie.” Needless to say, after feeling like the pediatrician had not been doing his due
        diligence, we switched to a new one.
      </p>

      <p>
        After recovery, my son’s feeding made yet another leap. We were now seeing feeding go to 20-30
        minutes from that hour. Trust me, when you have 8 feeds in a day, that is a huge deal. At this point, we
        thought we were out of the woods. However, my son was still showing signs of discomfort with his
        feedings, and my wife wanted to look into it further.
      </p>

      <p>
        My wife works doing speech therapy for our local school district, and while she specializes in children’s
        speaking, the program also encompasses feeding therapy. As such, my wife asked a friend who had gone
        through that part of the program more recently for an opinion. After confirming his struggles, we were
        referred to do a swallow study at Primary Children’s hospital.
      </p>

      <p>
        The results? Our son had a swallowing disorder called dysphagia where his epiglottis, the flap that
        covers your windpipe when you swallow, was not closing properly. Fortunately, his vocal cords were
        acting as a secondary protection for his lungs and prevented him from aspirating, where food goes into
        the lungs causing pneumonia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, we had an appointment with an ENT to verify the cause of the dysphagia. She looked and gave her
        opinion that it was laryngomalacia, basically a weak larynx that he should grow out of as he develops.
      </p>

      <p>
        As such, we then started feeding therapy. Our therapist recommended and showed us how to thicken our
        son’s formula and breast milk to make feeding him safer. Doing this process became a battle, multiple
        times each day. And it would take at least 20 minutes each time, even if you did get it right. The
        process of thickening was rather unforgiving; temperature, hydration time, agitation vigor, and amount
        of thickener all had important roles to play, and it seemed like each time we did it produced varying
        results. Breastmilk threw in new levels of chaos. Sometimes it was too thick and had to be watered
        (milked) down. Sometimes it was too thin, and on those you might as well throw out the bottle and start
        over as you were nearly guaranteed lumps if you simply added more thickener. Even the therapist, who
        dealt with this regularly, could mess things up in the process and spend more than half our time with
        her dialing in on the correct level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing, however, was worse than those times when you forgot a feed was coming up and trying to work
        this sensitive process while your child is crying out in hunger. This was amplified on those instances
        where you had to start all over, asking your wailing infant to be patient while you swear at the whole
        thing under your breath.
      </p>

      <p>
        After many nights of frustration, I decided there had to be a better way.  
        I couldn't stand by watching my wife break down in tears every time our son had a bad feeding experience. 
        I set out to engineer a solution that would take the guesswork out of thickening formula and breast milk. 
        Thus began my journey into creating a formula thickening machine that could consistently produce the right texture every time, hopefully allowing others to avoid the same struggles.
